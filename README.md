# Calculate Class Overlap
The purpose of this project is to examine the extent to which the embeddings of any two classes of labeled documents overlap. I will explore visualizations of these embeddings but my ultimate goal is to have a metric that can provide a quick summary of the comparison of all classes and guide further investigation. The main use case I have for this is when conducting quality assurance / quality control of the labeling of documents. With the overlap metric and a summary graphic, an individual or team could quickly determine which categories they may need to examine more closely. In particular, I intend this to be a decision tool: human labeling and review is often the most time-intensive step in creating structured date, and this will help people decide where in their data they have the greatest need to commit the time to (re-)read the source documents of overlapping categories and determine whether or not the existing labels make sense or need to change.

I calculate a kernel density estimate for each class and then integrate each pair of classes to calculate an overlap metric. The goal is to generate a heat map that quickly guides the viewer to the classes with the most overlap.
